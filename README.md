# üìï Laravel Library
This is a curated library of articles and tutorials on Laravel. It follows the structure of the [official Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/master).

It is a minimal viable solution to a wish you may share: 
> As a Laravel developer I want to find the best articles that elaborate on topics in the official documentation.

If the library proves to be useful, it will become an own searchable app with added value.
